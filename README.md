# Style transfer
Style transfer is a computer vision technique that allows us to recompose the content of an image in the style of another. If youâ€™ve ever imagined what a photo might look like if it were painted by a famous artist, then style transfer is the computer vision technique that turns this into a reality.It is a technique that blends the two images to produce a new stylised image.
# Description of project
Now days, we all are fond of clicking pictures and applying filters to give them new look but sometimes we don't find style of our choice in the filters but computer vision technique "style transfer" made it easier for us to choose any image and and any style of our choice and on combining them we will end up with a new stylised image which contains style of our own choice.
In this project we have performed a style transfer algorithm over the content and style images to extract the content of the content_image and style of the style_image,which further resulted in a new stylised image which was the combination of both of the content and style image.The project resulted in optimization of the task of concatenating the images to produce a artistic style image and made very easy to produce your own image in which ever style you want.

In this project we have also allowed the user to choose within the 3 best styles and obtain the image in that selected style...
